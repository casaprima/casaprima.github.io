            <span class="pilcrow">¶</span> Hi! My name is Felipe Casaprima. I’m
            a type designer and graphic designer currently based in Perth, WA.
          </p>
          <p class="text">
            <span class="pilcrow">¶</span> After a couple of years studying (but
            not really enjoying) engineering, I went to study design at <span class="text-link">ESDI</span> .
            There I discovered a passion for typography and eventually type
            design. I guess the conceptualisation of these complex systems [of
            letters] with a more artistic approach, if you will, really
            resonated with me.
          </p>
          <p class="text">
            <span class="pilcrow">¶</span> During an exchange year in Canada, I
            had the opportunity to work at <span class="text-link">Coppers and Brasses</span>, where I got to
            sharpen my typographical eye and learn the nuts and bolts of font
            production. After that I implemented those concepts creating type
            identities for all sorts of businesses at <span class="text-link">Plau</span>. For some of the work
            I developed there check out my <span class="text-link">behance</span>.
          </p>
          <p class="text">
            <span class="pilcrow">¶</span> As it turns out, my years in
            engineering weren’t a complete waste. With a solid base in
            programming I develop tools for improved workflow and for helping me
            bring original design to life, for example, doing some research on
            variable fonts and how to apply Bézier curves for interpolation.
